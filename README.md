Game Of Life
------------

A meteor app that let's you play [Conway's game of life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life), against other players. For now, it is single player. You score points for every net new generations you created in every iteration. 

View the app live [here](http://gameoflife.ramseydsilva.com).

TODO
----

In future, you should be able to play against another players, whereby you have a set time to create a pattern and see which pattern kills the other off. Feel free to browse the source code and contribute!
